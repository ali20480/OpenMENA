# OpenMENA

This repository contains the supplementary material of the preprint paper "OpenMENA: An Open-Source Memristor Interfacing and Compute Board for Neuromorphic Edge-AI Applications" by Ali Safa et al., College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar.

Assembling the OpenMENA PCB can be challenging due to the use of tiny surface-mount components. To alleviate this, we **offer support** for assembling and shipping the OpenMENA hardware platform to fellow researcher, for more information feel free to send an email at: **asafa@hbku.edu.qa** and we will be in touch.
